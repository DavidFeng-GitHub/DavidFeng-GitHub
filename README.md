### 👋 Hi, I'm David

I’m a graduate student at the University of Oxford studing Social Data Science. I am interested in using computational methods to answer questions about human behaviour. I am especially interested in applying natural language processing and network analysis to understand intergroup relations and cooperation dynamics online.


### 🗂 In the past, I've worked on:
- Applying NLP (topic modelling) to identify social norms on Reddit communities.
- Combining network science and NLP to examine the diffusion of sentiment on Reddit's political community.
- Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision-tree) to predict anxiety and depression diagnoses.
- Cross-cultural research on temporal discounting published in Nature Human Behaviour.


### 👨‍🎓 More about me:
I graduated from the LSE with a First-Class Honours in Psychology and Behavioural Science in 2023. My BSc thesis used multilevel modelling to understand the association between religion, cooperation and environmental stability. The thesis found that religious identity promoted cooperative behaviour across religious groups, but is constrained by highly unstable environments: the findings suggest that religious diversity does not inherently lead to intergroup conflict! The thesis was jointly awarded the Best Performance award.


### 📊 Some of my technical skills:
I have 3+ years of experience in programming, including in Python, R and SQL.

Inferential Statistics and ML: Single & multivariate regression, binary & multinomial logistic regression, multi-level models, decision-tree, random-forest, Naive Bayes, k-means clustering, principal components analysis, factor analysis, support-vector machine, hyper-parameter tuning techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation, test-train split).

Natural Language Processing: Sentiment analysis, topic modelling (LDA), TFIDF, Naive Bayes text classifiers.
