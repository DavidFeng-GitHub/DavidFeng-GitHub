### 👋 Hi, I'm David

I’m a graduate student at the University of Oxford studying Social Data Science. I am interested in using computational methods to answer questions about human behaviour. I am especially interested in applying natural language processing and network analysis to understand information diffusion and cooperation dynamics online.


### 🗂 I've worked on:
- [Applying NLP](https://github.com/DavidFeng-GitHub/reddit-nlp) to identify social norms on Reddit communities.
- Combining network science and NLP to examine the diffusion of sentiment on Reddit's political community.
- [Using machine learning algorithms](https://github.com/DavidFeng-GitHub/ml-models-of-anxiety-and-depression) (e.g., decision-tree) to predict anxiety and depression diagnoses.
- [Cross-cultural research](https://github.com/DavidFeng-GitHub/nature-publication) on temporal discounting published in Nature Human Behaviour.

You can find samples of my work in my repositories: I'll be adding past and present work over time.


### 👨‍🎓 More about me:
I graduated from the LSE with a First-Class Honours in Psychology and Behavioural Science in 2023. My BSc thesis used multilevel modelling to understand the association between religion, cooperation and environmental stability. [The thesis](https://github.com/DavidFeng-GitHub/bsc-thesis) found that religious identity promoted cooperative behaviour across religious groups, but is constrained by highly unstable environments: the findings suggest that religious diversity does not inherently lead to intergroup conflict! The thesis was jointly awarded the Best Performance award.


### 📈 Some of my technical skills:
I have 3+ years of experience in programming, including in Python, R and SQL.

Inferential Statistics: Single & multivariate regression, binary & multinomial logistic regression, factor analysis, multi-level models, latent growth curve models, structural equation models.

ML: Decision-tree, random-forest, Naive Bayes, k-means clustering, principal components analysis, support-vector machine, neural networks, optimization (e.g., gradient descent), regularization (e.g., L1, L2), hyper-parameter tuning (e.g., k-fold cross-validation, test-train-validation split).

Computational Social Science: _NLP_ -> Sentiment analysis, topic modelling (LDA), TFIDF, Naive Bayes text classifiers. _Networks_ -> Community detection, network metrics.
